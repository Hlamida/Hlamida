# Hi, Iâ€™m Aleksandr ðŸ‘‹

I build production-grade AI agent platforms and telephony integrations. My recent work focuses on multi-agent orchestration and tool-enabled agents using LangChain, LangGraph and LangSmith, plus real-time voice integrations (SIP/VoIP) for automated call flows and conversational interfaces.

## What I work on
- AI agent orchestration: composing planners, retrievers and executors into robust workflows; session/state management; safe tool usage and grounding strategies.
- Productionizing agent systems: scalable backend services, embeddings + vector search pipelines, caching and secure data access patterns.
- Telephony + voice AI: connecting agents to telephony channels via SIP/VoIP, implementing ASR/TTS flows and session orchestration for live-call automation.
- Research â†’ production: experiment tracking and telemetry-driven policy updates for agent behaviour tuning.

## Recent focus (general summary)
Iâ€™ve been leading backend and AI engineering for systems that integrate multi-agent orchestration with high-throughput retrieval and grounding. Work includes designing resilient agent pipelines, building embedding and vector-search layers, creating human-in-the-loop policy tuning loops, and enabling agent access to live telephony channels for voice-driven automation. Many of these codebases are private; the README uses anonymized summaries rather than per-repo writeups.
